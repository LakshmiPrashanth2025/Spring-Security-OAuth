### Guides
The following guides illustrate how to use some features concretely:

* [Accessing data with MySQL](https://spring.io/guides/gs/accessing-data-mysql/)

### Maven Parent overrides

Due to Maven's design, elements are inherited from the parent POM to the project POM.
While most of the inheritance is fine, it also inherits unwanted elements like `<license>` and `<developers>` from the parent.
To prevent this, the project POM contains empty overrides for these elements.
If you manually switch to a different parent and actually want the inheritance, you need to remove those overrides.

### OAuth
Access Token (AT) : A short-lived credential (typically valid for a few minutes to an hour) that acts as a secure "digital key".

Refresh Token (RT) : A long-lived credential (valid for days, weeks, or even indefinitely) issued alongside an access token.

###How They Work Together
### Initial Login: 
The user logs in and grants the app access. 
The Authorization Server returns an AT and an RT.

### Making Requests: 
The app uses the AT to fetch data (e.g., retrieving photos or reading emails).

### Expiration: 
Once the short-lived AT expires, the API returns an "Unauthorized" (401) error.
